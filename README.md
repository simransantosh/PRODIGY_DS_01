# Task-01: Population Distribution Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to visualize the population distribution of different countries over the years using bar charts and histograms. The dataset used contains population data for various countries over multiple years.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from `/content/task01_Dataset.csv`, containing information about the population of different countries over several years.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Load the dataset using pandas to understand its structure.
   - Select a country for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Filter population data for the chosen country.
   - Extract years and population data.
   - Create visualizations:
     - **Bar Chart**: Illustrates the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
     - **Histogram**: Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.

3. **Repeat Analysis for Different Countries**:
   - Repeat the analysis and visualization process for different countries to compare population trends and distributions.

## Population Analysis for Different Countries

### Belgium
- Filter population data for Belgium and visualize the population trend and distribution.

### United States
- Filter population data for the United States and visualize the population trend and distribution.

### Austria
- Filter population data for Austria and visualize the population trend and distribution.

## Visualizations

- **Bar Chart**:
  - Displays the population trend of the chosen country over the years.
  - X-axis: Year
  - Y-axis: Population
  - Title: Population Trend of [Chosen Country] Over the Years

- **Histogram**:
  - Represents the distribution of population data for the chosen country.
  - X-axis: Population
  - Y-axis: Frequency
  - Title: Distribution of Population in [Chosen Country]

## Usage

To perform population distribution analysis for different countries:
- Ensure the dataset (`task01_Dataset.csv`) is accessible.
- Run the provided code for each country of interest.
- Analyze the bar chart and histogram to understand population trends and distributions for each country.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Plotting library for creating visualizations.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical computations.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the population distribution of various countries over the years, facilitating understanding of demographic patterns and changes. Further analysis can explore correlations with socio-economic factors and policymaking implications.
